## Supported browsers

Omnibookmarks supports most desktop browsers:

- Mobile browsers

## Development

To create a release for Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera):

```sh
# Creates a release at dist/omnibookmarks-chromium
./scripts/package-chromium.sh
```

To create a release for FireFox:

```sh
# Creates a release at dist/omnibookmarks-firefox
./scripts/package-firefox.sh
```

## Inspiration

Omnibookmarks is heavily inspired by Hashmem, an extension that is no longer available. Hashmem provided the same approach for saving and opening URLs, but it had several significant drawbacks:

- Removed from the Chrome Web Store for an unnamed policy violation and was also unavailable for FireFox.
- Required granting the extension permission to send HTTP requests to several URLs controlled by the author.
- Not open source, and its JavaScript files were obfuscated.
- Saved bookmarks using the extension storage API instead of saving them to the browser's built-in bookmarks database.

So, Omnibookmarks seeks to provide a replacement for Hashmem without these drawbacks.
